      <strong>I'm on a mission to build inspiring user experiences üöÄ</strong><br>
<br>Growing up I had always envisioned a career in Marketing for myself. Little did I know where I‚Äôd end up‚Ä¶ but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br>
<br>
Why did I think Marketing was right for me?<br>
<br>Because, I loved the collaboration, creative thinking, and problem-solving that the industry promised. All of which was true, but Marketing lacked one aspect I craved - working with the actual product! <br>
<br>Fast forward to a year after graduation, I landed a job as a Product Manager for a tech startup. Definitely not what I set out to do - but looking back at it, it‚Äôs a role I‚Äôm perfectly suited for. <br>
<br>Now, I‚Äôm enjoying learning as much as I can through actual product practice, incessantly asking why üòâ, mentors, and making mistakes (yes, I make mistakes - but I make sure to learn from them!). <br>
<br>And, my journey doesn‚Äôt stop there, like I said I‚Äôm on a mission to build awesome user experiences wherever I go. If you relate, I‚Äôd love to connect (2 heads are better than 1 as the saying goes)!
